<h3> About me </h3> 

Hi there! I am a Postdoc Research Fellow in Learning Analytics with the Connected Intelligence Centre at the University of Technology Sydney, where I work with Professor Kirsty Kitto, studying the application of skills analytics in education. I am interested in the use of the labour market's skill language in presenting different educational objects (course, subject, student's profile, etc.) and their relationships. To do that, I use an intersection of data science, skills analytics, and information retrieval techniques on different types of dataset (educational, labour insights, demographic, occupational, etc.) which help with problems that higher education faces, such as curriculum skill gaps, higher education skill-based course recommendation system, and graduate-employability (find out more about why I do what I do in lower sections).
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to construct a taxonomy from scratch and use it to parse textual data, and am focused on technical evaluation of the skill-based presentation of curricula, and am aiming to creating a network of skillified entities where objects from different contexts (students, employers, academics, job recruiters) can speak the same (skill) language.

<h3> My Euology </h3> 
It all goes back to the oldest question of all existentialists: what am I? Human's strongest weapon is the product of a unique combination of human consciousness (the part of me that knows with proof that I exist) and the intellect ( which enables consciousness to come to the conclusion that I exist). This weapon is not, however, strong enough yet to attack more fundamental questions around the origins of life or its destination. I think that the day humans uncover the answer to such questions will be the day the human race is advanced enough to create its own brand of "perfection" and have life designed and implemented as a scientific experiment on some random planet. What we do know is our bodies are constantly evolving and, throughout millions of years, our biology's main destination has always been and will always be "perfection". How do we train our brain muscles? Education (learning how to think according to a context) and research (applying the newly attained way/s of thinking to different problems) hand in hand will improve the brain's muscle quality to the point that brain is fully utilized. I do my part in this very moment that I'm conscious by helping the research areas that aim to have high quality education equally available for all conscious creatures on the planet. I would like to be known as a person who was active in helping humans get one step closer to perfection.
<h3> My Research Statement</h3> 
My research journey began when I was introduced to education research by Professor Raymond Lister, who was focused on understanding how to teach programming languages to novice programmers and how to assess these students on what we taught them. After that, I was involved in data processing and visualisation as part of a series of publications. It was around that time when I started using my computational skills in the field of biology. My research was more focused around microRNAs and how to identify human genes which are orchestrated by these molecules. Given the unfortunate circumstances of funding, I had to stop that work and redirect my focus on the use of data science in computer science education, where I wrote a PhD thesis on "how can we use data analytics and learning analytics techniques to identify students who don't have a 'geek gene' for learning programming". Upon completion of that PhD, my next stop was looking at student's homework, feedback data, conversation data and other types of educational dataset and exploring how computer science and data analytics can help to create EdTech tools that can improve online teaching and learning. My current stop is learning analytics, where different types of data sets are integrated to construct a global network that enables lifelong learner level presentation of different entities and how they interact with each other. <br>

<h3> My Teaching Statement</h3> 
I have the experience of teaching more 5,000 students at University of technology Sydney. Majority of the subjects that I teached at UTS are offered by school of computer science FKA school of software. The primary subjects of my interests are programming fundamentals, and database fundamentals, from which the main data for my PhD was collected.
