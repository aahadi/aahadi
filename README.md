<h3> About me </h3> 

Hi there! I am a Postdoc Research Fellow in Learning Analytics with the Connected Intelligence Centre at the University of Technology Sydney, where I work with Professor Kirsty Kitto, studying the application of skills analytics in education. I am interested in the use of the labour market's skill language in presenting different educational objects (course, subject, student's profile, etc.) and their relationships. To do that, I use an intersection of data science, skills analytics, and information retrieval techniques on different types of dataset (educational, labour insights, demographic, occupational, etc.) which help with problems that higher education faces, such as curriculum skill gaps, higher education skill-based course recommendation system, and graduate-employability (find out more about why I do what I do in lower sections).
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to construct a taxonomy from scratch and use it to parse textual data, and am focused on technical evaluation of the skill-based presentation of curricula, and am aiming to creating a network of skillified entities where objects from different contexts (students, employers, academics, job recruiters) can speak the same (skill) language.

<h3> My Teaching Statement</h3> 
I have experience teaching more than 5,000 students at the University of Technology in Sydney. Most of the subjects that I taught at UTS are offered by the computer science school, formally known as the Software School. The primary subjects of my interests are programming fundamentals and database fundamentals, from which the main data for my PhD were collected.
